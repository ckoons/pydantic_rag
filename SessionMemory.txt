# Session Memory: Pydantic RAG Project

## Session Date: February 25, 2025

## Project Summary
We built a simplified RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for Pydantic AI documentation with these key features:
- Web crawler with configurable depth and timeout settings
- Vector embeddings using OpenAI's API
- SQLite database for storage
- Streamlit-based UI with tabs for crawling and querying

## Current State
- Repository path: /Users/cskoons/projects/work/pydantic_rag
- Main code file: combined_crawler_ui.py
- The system is fully functional but could use enhancements (see Future Enhancements)
- Database file created: pydantic_docs_simple.db
- Git repository initialized with initial commit

## Technical Details
- Using OpenAI embeddings API for semantic search
- BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing
- Streamlit for the UI
- SQLite for lightweight storage
- Recursive crawling implementation with depth control
- Cosine similarity for vector search

## Code Approach
- We created a combined script rather than separate modules for simplicity
- We built a system to extract and store text from web pages
- We implemented vector search using embeddings
- We used async functions for better performance
- We created a tabbed UI for different functions

## Future Enhancements
1. Add filtering options to control which links are followed during crawling
2. Implement user authentication for the Streamlit interface 
3. Add support for PDF and other document formats
4. Integrate with Pydantic models for structured data extraction
5. Add tests for the crawler and RAG components
6. Implement caching to reduce API calls
7. Create a Docker container for easy deployment
8. Add support for other embedding models (e.g., local models)

## What We Accomplished
- Created a functional RAG system from scratch
- Set up a clean project structure
- Initialized git version control
- Made the crawler capable of recursive crawling
- Implemented vector search for semantic querying
- Created a clean, functional UI with Streamlit

## Last Actions
- Added session documentation files
- Committed all changes to git
- Prepared instructions for pushing to GitHub
