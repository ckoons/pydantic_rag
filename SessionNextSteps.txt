# Pydantic RAG - Next Steps

## Project Overview
You've created a simplified RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for Pydantic documentation. The application has:

1. A web crawler that can fetch and store documentation
2. A chat interface that uses vector search to answer questions
3. A simple SQLite database for storing documents and embeddings

## How to Run the Application
1. Set up your environment:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/cskoons/projects/work/pydantic_rag
   
   # Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Set up your .env file
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env to add your OpenAI API key
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run combined_crawler_ui.py
   ```

3. Using the application:
   - Go to the "Crawler" tab to add documents to your knowledge base
   - Enter URLs to crawl (e.g., https://ai.pydantic.dev/)
   - Adjust depth and timeout settings as needed
   - Use the "Chat" tab to ask questions about the crawled content

## Push to GitHub
The project is ready to be pushed to GitHub. Here's how:

1. Go to GitHub in your browser (https://github.com)
2. Create a new repository named `pydantic_rag`
3. Make it public or private as you prefer
4. Don't initialize it with a README, .gitignore, or license (we already have those)
5. After creating it, run these commands:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/cskoons/projects/work/pydantic_rag
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/pydantic_rag.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   (Replace YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username)

## Future Enhancements
Consider these improvements for your RAG system:

1. Add filtering options to control which links are followed during crawling
2. Implement user authentication for the Streamlit interface 
3. Add support for PDF and other document formats
4. Integrate with Pydantic models for structured data extraction
5. Add tests for the crawler and RAG components
6. Implement caching to reduce API calls and improve performance
7. Create a Docker container for easy deployment
8. Add support for other embedding models (e.g., local models via LlamaIndex)
